Insert a Bible reading plan into your posts or pages.

== Description ==

If you've never read the entire Bible, you should. If you have, you should again. :-)

Traditores In-One-Year allows you to insert a table of Bible readings into your posts or pages. Each day has a link to that day's text at the free Bible service from Biblia.com.

Features include being able to automatically scroll to today's reading, putting today's reading at the top of the table, and choosing from ten translations.

== Installation ==

The preferred installation method is through Wordpress itself, using "Plugins|Add New|Search Plugins" and then searching for "Traditores In-One-Year". However, you can manually use "Plugins|Add New|Upload" with the trad-ioy.zip file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Traditores In-One-Year is brand new, so there are no questions, let alone frequently asked ones. :-)

Traditores In-One-Year is the first Wordpress plugin produced by Traditores (http://traditores.org) and written by Alan Fahrner (http://www.TheSolver.us/resume/). It will always be free, but if you want to show appreciation, please give a listen to Traditores Radio (http://tradio.in) and, if you like it, let us know (and tell your friends about Traditores Radio).

Actually, even if you don't like it, please let us know. In either case:

And, that address is also a good way to let us know if you run into any issues, have any suggestions, or would like us to provide some other Bible reading plans.

If you've never read the entire Bible, you should. If you have, you should again. :-)
