<p>Gotta love options, eh? <em>Traditores In-One-Year</em> is a simple Wordpress plugin, but it has a decent amount of options (described below)...</p>
<hr />
<h3>Page/Post Setting</h3>
<p>There is a single setting avaialble for each post and page. It&#39;s purpose is to keep <em>Traditores In-One-Year</em>&#39;s impact minimal by only loading CSS and JavaScript libraries (and doing shortcode substitutions) when you really want it to. It shows up under &quot;Traditores IOY.&quot;</p>
<h4>Activate Shortcodes</h4>
<p>Check this if you want to use the <em>Traditores In-One-Year</em> shortcode.</p>

<p>Choose the default Bible version.</p>
<h4>Page Behavior</h4>
<p>Three checkboxes:</p>
<strong><em>Scroll to today&#39;s entry?</em></strong>

<strong><em>Keep user's Bible preference in a cookie?</em></strong>
<p>Check if you want to keep your visitor&#39;s preferred Bible version in a cookie (so they don&#39;t have to choose it every time they return).</p>
